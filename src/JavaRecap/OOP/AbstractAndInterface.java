    /*
    POSSIBLE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:
    1-What is abstract and can you clarify with a little detail?

     Sure, Abstract is a way to organize methods with "NECESSARY INFORMATION"(template)
     you do not have "BODY" for abstract methods.It means people can see the template of
     the method and "OVERRIDE" this based on their requirement.

    2-Why do you need abstract in your project?

      to reduce the amount of duplication in the project which will prevent confusion
      during method calls for people.

    3-Can you create an object from abstract?

     You cannot create an object from abstract.You will be able to access the methods
     by "OVERRIDING" them.

    4-Can you have normal and abstract method inside abstract class?

    Yes you can both methods inside of abstract class

    INTERFACE:

    1-What is interface?

     Interface is a blueprint(template) of the class which as special methods(abstract) methods that can be
     overridden to make new implementations.

       -->To be able to make a connection with Class and Interface, we use "IMPLEMENTS" keyword.

    2-Why do you need interface if you have abstract?

      -->because interface has more functionality and you can access multiple interface.(multiple parents-Implements)

    3-What is the difference between Interface and Abstract? *****THE MOST COMMON QUESTION*****

    INTERFACE:
    1-It is declared with "INTERFACE"
    2-can have only public abstract methods(exception is default keyword)
    3-to make a connection with class we use "IMPLEMENTS" keyword
    4-You can inherit as many interface you want. It means you can use multiple IMPLEMENTS
    5-Cannot have constructor
    6-public final static default for variable

    ABSTRACT:
    1-It is declared with "ABSTRACT"
    2-may or may not have regular methods.
    3-To make a connection with class we use "EXTENDS"keyword
    4-You can use Extends only ONCE.
    5-Can have constructor
    6-no default value for variable
