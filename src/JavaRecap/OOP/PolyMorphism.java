    /*
    POSSIBLE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:
    1-What is polymorphism?
     -->It is the different forms of the object
       List lt=new ArrayList(); -->polymorphism
       Map mp=new TreeMap();

    2-What is dynamic and static polymorphism?

     -->Dynamic PolyMorphism-->is all about OVERRIDING.(actions)
     -->Static PolyMorphism ->is all about OVERLOADING.

    3-What is the difference between overloading and overriding?

     -->OVERLOADING:
     1-Overloading needs to be in "SAME CLASS"
     2-Overloading can have final static private keyword.
        METHOD SIGNATURE: --> Name of the method + Parameters -->run(int speed)
                           -->public void run(int speed)
                           -->public void run(int speed,String name)
     3-It happens during COMPILE TIME


     -->OVERRIDING:
     1-Overriding needs to be in "DIFFERENT CLASS" -->inheritance(subclasses)
     2-Overriding cannot have private final static.
     3-It happens during RUN TIME.
