    /*
    POSSIBLE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:
    1-How do you handle exceptions?
      We can handle the exceptions with TRY AND CATCH, THROW AND THROWS.

    2-Can you use more than 1 catch block? how about try block?

    -->You can use only one try block and as many as catch block you want.

    3-What do you know about final,finalize,finally?

    final:is a keyword to make the variable or method,class unchangeable(last version)
    finalize:is a method to prove that GC is working as expected.
    finally:is a block that comes after try and catch block to do final execution.
    No matter what this block will run.(database.disconnect)

    4-What is the difference between throw and throws?

     -->Both throw and throws are the concept of exception handling in which throws
     I used to explicitly(out of block) throws the exception from a method

     public void exception() throws NumberFormatException{

     public void exception2(){
     new throw NumberFormatException(e).
     */
}
